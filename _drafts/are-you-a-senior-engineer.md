How can you tell if you are a senior engineer? I'm not talking about your title, but about your maturity, experience, and impact as an engineer. You can have the coolest-sounding title and still be immature; and you don't have to wait for the title to start making impact. Here are three questions that you might want to ask yourself.

#### Can you explain why a particular technical choice is made?
If you ask an inexperienced engineer why this particular technology or architecture was chosen over the alternatives, chances are that they would reply "it was like this before me", or "that's just how we do it", or "I used it because I worked with it before". A senior engineer can explain the choice, back it up with comparisons, or at least speculate about the reasons (if it weren't them who made the choice). They are able to do so because of their experience, curiosity, and wide knowledge. They know about the alternatives and make conscious technical choices. They don't cargo cult (cargo culting is basically doing things you think you should do, without understanding *why*).

#### Can you tell a "premature optimization" from a "mature" one?
Premature optimization is the root of all evil. But how do you know when it is "premature"? By "optimization" I mean a variety of things: performance optimizations, refactorings, introducing abstractions, handling corner cases, and so on. This abstraction seems ridiculously unnecessary today, but postponing it will result in a tech debt that will haunt you in three years. This degenerate usecase only happens theoretically once a year and is solved by a restart, so no need to spend a month overengineering and handling it gracefully. A senior engineer can estimate the urgency and importance of the work and decide whether to do it now or postpone it. If they cut corners, they do so consciously.

#### Are you a mentor or a mentee?
This is pretty self-explanatory. Mentors share their knowledge and experience, promote good practices, and provide advice and guidance to those who need it. Mentees seek guidance, ask questions, and absorb knowledge. There is nothing bad about it -- in fact, being a good mentee is just as difficult as being a good mentor. We find ourselves on both ends on this relationship. It's important to be curious, ask the right questions, be ready to learn, and also ready to teach others what you have learned. Good engineers do good work; good senior engineers enable others to do good work as well.

#### How to get there
These questions are by no means formal, but rather are intended to encourage you to think about these matters. The path to maturity is challenging, and I'm convinced that getting there takes curiosity, effort to get out there and try new things, learning from that experience, and sharing your knowledge.
